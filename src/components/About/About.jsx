          <p>
            I am a Web Developer with a working profieciency in HTML, CSS, and
            Javascript. I am familiar with mobile-first design concepts and
            working with APIs. I have done both functional programming and
            object-oriented programming. <br /> <br /> I am always eager to grow
            as a developer and learning new things. Currently I am working on
            improving my skills in React and working with APIâ€™s. I am also
            interested in writing some server-side code to improve my knowledge
            of the backend.
            <br /> <br /> I would love to work in an environment where I can
            grow as a developer and work on providing real world solutions to
            improve the world we live in!
